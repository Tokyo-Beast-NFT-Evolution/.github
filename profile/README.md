## 🧬 What is Tokyo Beast?

Tokyo Beast is a stylish Web3 turn-based strategy game where you summon, evolve, and battle NFT monsters in neon-soaked arenas. Inspired by classic monster-training RPGs, the game allows you to collect beasts with unique traits, level them up, evolve them through battle, and earn crypto rewards through ranked competition and PvE raids.

Each beast is a tradable NFT, and strategic synergies unlock rare forms and abilities.
